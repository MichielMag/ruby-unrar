# ruby-unrar
When developing some simple personal server scripts, I noticed that there was no gem yet for working with rar files within ruby.

The gem will be nothing fancy, just doing whatever you could do from command line or bash scripts, but just with some ruby classes wrapped around it for using it in your scripts.

It's not a gem yet, and it misses some functionality that I myself didn't need yet, but it's a work in progress.
